This is not a draft post - I removed the coding that stopped both the page and the from/to links from appearing!


Today, I completed the task for my mandatory "Intro to JavaScript" lesson, as follows:

1 We’ll make a program to calculate a tip

Create variables for the pre-tip total and the tip percentage
Calculate the new total
Output a sentence to the page - something like:
Your total bill, with tip, is £35.45

BONUS POINTS:

Use toFixed() to round the output to 2 decimal places
Display the tip amount in the output as well
2 Extend the Tip program

Create variables for the pre-tip total and the tip percentage
Calculate the new total
Output a sentence to the page - something like:
“Your total bill, with tip, is £35.45”

Extension: round the figure to 2 DP and display the tip amount.

Additional
Make a Procedural Function in Javascript.

Please provide a link below to your Codepen with the tasks on. Also please add a blog about these tasks to your Blogs.
