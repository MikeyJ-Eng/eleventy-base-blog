# About Me
Hi, I‚Äôm Mike

üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Python and JavaScript employment. I'm up-skilling, so I accept that would be at a junior level. I've recently completed a Web Development and Design Bootcamp, and am currently undertaking intensive training in both Python and Cloud formation: AWS and Terraform via freeCodeCamp.

I used eleventy as part of my TCG Web Design Bootcamp, and I stored some of the course task results here. My aim is to eventually use it (or GitHub) for showcasing my work. üíûÔ∏è 

In my free time, I‚Äôm also looking to collaborate on any interesting projects.

I hate these large blocky texts, and I will update it to make it pretty (as a low priority); however, here's techie me...
